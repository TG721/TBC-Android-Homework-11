This is an app that shows list of Video-Games. The user has ability to add, update as well as remove items from the list and on the screen.
It's up to User to decide whether and which game list items he/she will have with image and without.
since this app only edits,adds and removes 1 element a a time, I did not really see reason to use DiffUtils and
We had 1 list which we kept updating, we were not getting new list from server or from database.
Refresh button is also present. The app uses URLs as its image sources.
